GoStack's eighth challenge, the beginning of GoMarketplace application!

Hello guys! This repository contains the beginning of the GoMarketplace application, which I intend to adapt in the future to something viable for my family to save their kitchen recipes.

To begin, it's necessary to use a Fake API to simulate the products route.

To do this, use the terminal to run:
<b> yarn json-server server.json -p 3333</b>

You can also see the tests provided by Rocketseat to test the application by running:
<b> yarn test </b>

For now, this is it! 
Keep coding!
